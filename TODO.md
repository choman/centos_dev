# To do

# ansible pull

to properly maintain git logs, learn how to test locally.. That way 
a branch can be created item tested thoroughly, then merged into the 
master branch.

NOTE: current doesn't work, maybe add -f?


# APPS
- cryfs
- gocryptfs
- goto (github)
- tmsu

- do not like the root assumption


# tmsu notes
  - works by downloading the generic tmsu.tar'ball
